## News
- **[2024/12/22]** Initial code released.
- **[2024/08/25]** Paper released on [arXiv](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.13863).

## Introduction
This is the code repository for the paper: [CodeGraph: Enhancing Graph Reasoning of LLMs with Code](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.13863).

We introduce CodeGraph, a method for reasoning about **basic graph problems** by encoding **graph problem solutions** as **code**. This method solves new graph problems by learning from exemplars, generating programs, and executing them via a program interpreter.

In the upper example, the limitation of LLMs in handling arithmetic within the graph task is highlighted, while our method addresses this issue through code and external execution. In the lower-left example, LLM performance is shown to be sensitive
to prompt templates that convert graph structures into natural language. The lower-right example demonstrates that the LLMâ€™s
performance is significantly influenced by the graph structure.



## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and start using **CodeGraph**:

### 1. Installation

Set up the required environment and APIs by following the instructions in the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).


### 2. Prepare the GraphQA Dataset

Generate graphs and prepare the dataset needed for evaluation by referring to the [Dataset Preparation Guide](docs/prepare_data.md).


### 3. Configure Prompts

Learn how to create prompts for **CodeGraph** and other prompt-based baseline methods by following the [Prompt Preparation Guide](docs/prepare_prompts.md). 

### 4. Run Evaluation

Reproduce the evaluation experiments presented in the paper. Detailed steps are available in the [Evaluation Guide](docs/evaluation.md).
